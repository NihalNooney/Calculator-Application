This Android-Studio build application that's able to calculate any 4 function math problem based on user inputs. This was my first ever Android-Studio project.

<h2>How it works</h2>
The application uses user input and stores them as strings. After, it's spliced based on spaces and the 4 function signs where it's then calculated and displayed in a user-friendly format.
